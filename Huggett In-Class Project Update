What research question do you want to answer?

How do sports teams and/or corporations respond to scandals or social issues in press releases?

What are two possible answers?

1. Press releases all use similar language and style across the spectrum
2. Their is great variance in the length, content, and style of press releases in response to scandals totally depending on context


What are the documents of text data you will analyze?

Press releases (Often fairly short, many available from social media)


Give two examples of documents in the corpus that you expect will be high in similarity to each other? Two examples that are *low* in similarity?

1. Raven's response to Ray Rice domestic violence management, Patriot's response to Deflategate court hearing

2. Kansas City Chiefs cutting Kareem Hunt for domestic violence, Chiefs keeping Tyreek Hill after finding no evidence of child abuse
